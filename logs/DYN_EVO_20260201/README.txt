EDiE Research Logs: DYN Track

Purpose

This directory is dedicated to storing raw experimental data, agent logs, and visual evidence generated during the Evolution of Adaptation under Abrupt Change (DYN) experiments.

Contents

DYN_EVO_20260201/: Bundled artifacts for the initial "Resilience as Justice" experiment.

readme.txt: This guide.

experiment_log.txt: Raw parameter transitions (LR, Friction, Loss).

2026-02-01_XXXXXX.png: Visual captures of the simulation and graphs.

Troubleshooting: Directory Duplication

If the GitHub UI shows duplicate DYN_EVO_20260201 folders:

Ensure there is no file named exactly DYN_EVO_20260201 (without extension) in the logs/ directory.

Check for case-sensitivity issues (e.g., dyn_evo... vs DYN_EVO...).

Standardize on the uppercase version for all research tracks.

Note on Data Integrity

These logs represent the "fossil record" of autonomous agent evolution. They serve as the empirical foundation for verifying the Resilience as Justice hypothesis.
