EDiE Research Logs: DYN Track

Purpose

This directory is dedicated to storing raw experimental data, agent logs, and visual evidence generated during the Evolution of Adaptation under Abrupt Change (DYN) experiments.

Contents

DYN_EVO_YYYYMMDD/: Bundled artifacts for specific experimental runs, including:

experiment_log.txt: Raw parameter transitions (LR, Friction, Loss).

evo_graph.png: Visualized lineage and fitness landscapes.

visuals/: Frame captures and behavioral recordings.

Note on Data Integrity

These logs represent the "fossil record" of autonomous agent evolution. They serve as the empirical foundation for verifying the Resilience as Justice hypothesis.
